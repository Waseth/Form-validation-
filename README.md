This project focuses on adding **form validation** to a contact form using **JavaScript**.
It ensures that all user inputs are properly checked before the form can be submitted.

## Features
- Validates **Full Name**, **Email**, **Phone Number**, and **Message** fields.
- Displays **real-time error messages** when input is invalid.
- Shows success feedback when all fields are valid.
- Uses **regular expressions (Regex)** for pattern checking.
- Automatically hides messages after a short delay for a cleaner UI.

## What I Learned
Through this project, I learned how to:
- Use **JavaScript form validation** techniques to handle user input.
- Write and apply **Regex** to validate names, emails, and phone numbers.
- Implement **conditional logic** using `if`, `else`, `return true/false`.
- Dynamically update the DOM using `.innerHTML` and CSS for feedback.
- Add **interactive error/success messages** that appear and disappear smoothly.
